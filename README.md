Fruzenshtein/security-spr fork
============

I had some problems to run Fruzenshtein project, so I decided to do some changes:

1. Spring Security version changed to 2.3.2.RELEASE
2. Database changed to SQLServer2008 (jtds driver artifact in pom.xml)
3. Custom, simple and single user authority table
